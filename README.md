# Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using a Transformer architecture from scratch. The goal of the model is to classify text data, such as movie reviews, as either positive or negative. This project covers the implementation of various Transformer components, including embedding layers, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and feed-forward networks.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **IMDb movie reviews dataset**, a popular dataset for binary sentiment classification tasks.

## Project Structure

1. **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and preprocess the IMDb movie reviews dataset.
   - Tokenize the text data and convert it into numerical format suitable for input to the Transformer model.

2. **Step 2: Create the Transformer Components**
   - Implement the core components of a Transformer: the Embedding Layer, Positional Encoding, Multi-Head Attention, and Feed-Forward Neural Networks.

3. **Step 3: Build the Transformer Encoder**
   - Combine the Transformer components to construct the Encoder layer, which processes the input data to create meaningful representations.

4. **Step 4: Implement the Sentiment Classification Model**
   - Construct the full Transformer model with a classification head to perform binary sentiment analysis.

5. **Step 5: Train the Model**
   - Train the Transformer model on the IMDb dataset using a typical training loop.

6. **Step 6: Evaluate the Model**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.
